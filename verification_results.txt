Summary: This is a report for a colonoscopy performed on Aram Ghannadzadeh, a 40-year-old male, on March 26, 2025. The colonoscopy was indicated due to rectal pain. The procedure was performed under direct vision up to the terminal ileum and was carefully done. The findings include glandular hypertrophied mucosa in the terminal ileum and internal and external hemorrhoids. The impression suggests glandular hypertrophy in the terminal ileum, hemorrhoids (grade II-III), which should be treated locally or with band ligation. The rest of the colon was normal. The recommendation is for the patient to be discharged after being fully awake.
